# Disease Propagation Model

Presented in this Repo is my final project for CS111 - Math Modeling. Accompanied are codes used in the project to build models, to analyze the model, and fit it with real data optained from WHO reports. All codes are written in R, as ut us the best fit for the analytic nature of the paper.

Because of the time stress, codes are not fully documented, but hopefully things make sense if the write-up is included.
